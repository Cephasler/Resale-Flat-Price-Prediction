# Resale-Flat-Price-Prediction

This repository contains the following:

Jupyter Notebooks used for data processing:
- Data Retrieval and Synthesis: this notebook includes the reading of csv files in pandas dataframe, accessing additional coordinates information via geopy and conversion of categorical data into continous/numerical data
- Data Analysis: includes data exploration of the final data set generated by the previous notebook, "Data Retrieval and Synthesis". The model for the resale price predictions was built using linear regression and then gradient boosting regressors which utilises gradient boosted decision trees. The feature importance was also retrieved from the code in order to serve as the basis to determine the main drivers of resale prices.
- Data Analysis with NN: this notebook works further beyond the previous analysis file and utilises the keras sequential model to build a baseline model and train it to predict the resale prices based on the same features as well.

CSV files containing the raw data as well as the data retrieved from similar projects on the web:
- mrtsg: this csv file contains the coordinates of all the mrt stations in singapore; orginal source: https://www.kaggle.com/yxlee245/singapore-train-station-coordinates
- mallsg: this csv file contains the coordiantes of all the malls in singapore; orginal source: https://github.com/ValaryLim/Mall-Coordinates-Web-Scraper
- street_name_coords_v1: this csv file contains the coordinates of all the unique steet names in the final resale flat prices data set
- resale_xxxx_xxxx: the csv files saved using this nomenclature are the resale prices downloaded from Data.gov.sg and eventually compiled into a single final dataset with the augmentation with other data files; original source: https://data.gov.sg/dataset/resale-flat-prices

Presentation slides:
- Documentation: runs through all the data processing steps from retrieval, wrangling, exploration, modelling and prediction. This inlcudes the entire approach of the data processign project, the insights and results as well as the use case recommendations
